# Bedshift: perturbation of genomic interval sets

Paper: [Manuscript at Genome Biology](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02440-w) 


## Abstract

Functional genomics experiments, like ChIP-Seq or ATAC-Seq, produce results that are summarized as a region set. There is no way to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of region set similarity metrics. We present Bedshift, a tool for perturbing BED files by randomly shifting, adding, and dropping regions from a reference file. The perturbed files can be used to benchmark similarity metrics, as well as for other applications. We highlight differences in behavior between metrics, such as that the Jaccard score is most sensitive to added or dropped regions, while coverage score is most sensitive to shifted regions.
