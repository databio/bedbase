Atacformer is a general-purpose transformer-based foundation model for genomic interval data, specifically designed for ATAC-seq data. It is part of the Geniml toolkit, which provides a suite of tools for genomic interval machine learning. Trained on a large corpus of ATAC-seq data, Atacformer can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks such as classification, regression, and sequence generation.

All pre-trained models are available on the [Hugging Face Hub](huggignface.co/databio), and you can easily load them using the `geniml` package:

```python
from geniml.atacformer import AtacformerForCellClustering

model = AtacformerForCellClustering.from_pretrained("databio/atacformer-base-hg38")
```
