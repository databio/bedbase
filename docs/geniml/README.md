## Introduction

Geniml is a *genomic interval machine learning toolkit*, a Python package for building machine learning models of genomic interval data (BED files). It also includes ancillary functions to support other types of analyses of genomic interval data.

As of Feburary 2024, this package and its documentation are undergoing rapid development, leading to some tutorials getting outdated. Please raise [github issues](https://github.com/databio/geniml) if you find outdated or unclear directions, so we know where to focus effort that will benefit users.

## Install

```
pip install --user --upgrade geniml
```

## Modules and resources by publication
