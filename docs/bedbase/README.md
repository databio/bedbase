# BEDbase

BEDbase is a unifying platform for aggregating, analyzing and serving genomic region data as BED files. Input files are processed by a series of Python pipelines. The output of these pipelines is displayed through a RESTful API where users can access BED files along with useful statistics and plots.

BEDbase can be accessed in two ways:

## 1. The web interface
