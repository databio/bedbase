# gtars-genomicdist

Rust port of the R [GenomicDistributions](https://code.databio.org/GenomicDistributions/) package — plus a handful of extra calculations and binary serialization formats used by BEDbase. The crate provides:

- **Summary statistics** and per-chromosome distributions (`GenomicIntervalSetStatistics` trait).
- **Interval set algebra** in the GRanges/IRanges idiom (`IntervalRanges` trait, 26+ methods).
- **Genomic partitioning** using a gene model (promoter / UTR / exon / intron / intergenic).
- **Signal matrix overlap and summary** (`calc_summary_signal`, TSV + packed-binary I/O).
- **Consensus region calling** across multiple input sets.
- **Nearest-TSS / nearest-feature distance** calculations (`TssIndex`).
- **GC content** and **dinucleotide frequency** against a reference genome.
- **BED file classification** (optional `bedclassifier` feature, polars-backed).
- **Density and clustering** statistics used for ML feature vectors and peak-clustering summaries.
- The **GDA** binary gene-model format and the **.fab** binary FASTA format for fast mmap-backed sequence lookup.

All operations take a `&RegionSet` (from `gtars-core`) as input and either extend it via trait implementations or run as free functions. If you're new to the crate, start with the `IntervalRanges` and `GenomicIntervalSetStatistics` traits — those cover the GRanges/GenomicDistributions surface area most users need.

!!! tip "Coming from R GenomicDistributions?"
    Most function names follow the pattern `calc_*` where R used `calc*`, and behavior is matched where practical. A few deliberate divergences are documented inline — the most notable is that midpoint calculations default to BED (floor) conventions rather than GRanges banker's rounding, and spacing/nearest-neighbor calculations *exclude* single-region chromosomes rather than emitting sentinel values.

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
gtars-genomicdist = "0.7"
```

### Feature flags

| flag | effect |
|---|---|
| *(default)* | All traits, statistics, partitions, signal, consensus, and TSS calculations. |
| `bedclassifier` | Enables `classify_bed()` and pulls in `polars`. Transitively enables `gtars-core/dataframe`. |

Enable the classifier feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
gtars-genomicdist = { version = "0.7", features = ["bedclassifier"] }
```

## Core types

All of these are re-exported at the crate root, so you typically import them directly:

```rust
use gtars_genomicdist::{
    // Statistics
    GenomicIntervalSetStatistics,
    ClusterStats, DensityHomogeneity, DensityVector, SpacingStats,
    // Interval algebra
    IntervalRanges, RegionSetListOps, pairwise_jaccard,
    // Strand-aware wrappers
    SortedRegionSet, Strand, StrandedRegionSet,
    // Partitions
    GeneModel, PartitionList, PartitionResult,
    ExpectedPartitionResult, ExpectedPartitionRow,
    calc_expected_partitions, calc_partitions, genome_partition_list,
    // Signal
    SignalMatrix, SignalSummaryResult, ConditionStats,
    calc_summary_signal,
    // Consensus
    ConsensusRegion, consensus,
    // Sequence stats
    calc_gc_content, calc_dinucl_freq, DINUCL_ORDER,
    // Utilities
    chrom_karyotype_key, median_abs_distance,
    // Gene model serialization
    GenomicDistAnnotation,
    // BED classifier (feature-gated)
    #[cfg(feature = "bedclassifier")] classify_bed,
    // Re-export from gtars-core
    CoordinateMode,
};
```

The submodules (`statistics`, `interval_ranges`, `partitions`, `signal`, `consensus`, `models`, `asset`, `bed_classifier`, `utils`) are all `pub` as well, so both `gtars_genomicdist::calc_partitions` and `gtars_genomicdist::partitions::calc_partitions` resolve to the same symbol.

## Statistics

The `GenomicIntervalSetStatistics` trait extends `RegionSet` with two kinds of summaries:

1. **Per-region and per-pair quantities** — direct ports of the R GenomicDistributions functions (`calcWidth`, `calcNeighborDist`, `calcNearestNeighbors`, `calcChromBins`). These return vectors or per-chromosome tables, one number per peak or per gap. Use them when you want to *see* each value — plot a histogram, feed them to a downstream test, render a per-chromosome heatmap.

2. **Whole-set scalar summaries** — new in gtars. These collapse an entire peak set into a handful of numbers that answer questions like "how regularly are my peaks spaced?", "how clumpy is this peak set?", or "how evenly is it spread across the genome?". Each one wraps a per-region calculation and reduces it to a scalar / small struct. Use them when you want to *compare* peak sets against each other or a baseline, build ML feature vectors, or run peak-set QC.

Bring the trait into scope and both kinds of methods appear on any `RegionSet`.

### Per-region and per-pair quantities

Direct ports of R GenomicDistributions. Each returns a vector or per-chromosome table.

```rust
use gtars_core::models::RegionSet;
use gtars_genomicdist::GenomicIntervalSetStatistics;

let peaks = RegionSet::try_from("peaks.bed")?;

// Per-chromosome summary: count, min/max/mean/median width, chr bounds
for (chr, stats) in peaks.chromosome_statistics() {
    println!(
        "{chr}: {} regions, median width {}",
        stats.number_of_regions,
        stats.median_region_length
    );
}

// Region-width distribution (one value per region)
let widths: Vec<u32> = peaks.calc_widths();

// Signed inter-region gaps on each chromosome (only positive gaps are returned)
let gaps: Vec<i64> = peaks.calc_neighbor_distances()?;

// Nearest-neighbor distance per region (multi-region chromosomes only)
let nn: Vec<u32> = peaks.calc_nearest_neighbors()?;
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

| method | question it answers | returns |
|---|---|---|
| `chromosome_statistics()` | "What do the per-chromosome counts and width distributions look like?" | `HashMap<String, ChromosomeStatistics>` |
| `region_distribution_with_bins(n_bins)` | "How many peaks fall in each of `n_bins` bins sized by the longest chromosome?" | `HashMap<String, RegionBin>` |
| `region_distribution_with_chrom_sizes(n_bins, chrom_sizes)` | Same, but bins are sized per-chromosome by actual chromosome length — matches R `getGenomeBins` | `HashMap<String, RegionBin>` |
| `calc_widths()` | "How wide is each peak?" — port of R `calcWidth()` | `Vec<u32>` |
| `calc_neighbor_distances()` | "What's the bp gap between every pair of consecutive peaks on each chromosome?" | `Result<Vec<i64>>` |
| `calc_nearest_neighbors()` | "How far is each peak from its closest neighbor?" — port of R `calcNearestNeighbors()` | `Result<Vec<u32>>` |

### Whole-set scalar summaries

These collapse the peak set to a handful of numbers, answering questions about **spatial arrangement** across the genome. They're complementary to the per-region quantities above — each one internally calls one of the per-region methods and then summarizes the result.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use gtars_core::models::RegionSet;
use gtars_genomicdist::GenomicIntervalSetStatistics;

let peaks = RegionSet::try_from("peaks.bed")?;
let chrom_sizes: HashMap<String, u32> =
    [("chr1".into(), 248_956_422), ("chr2".into(), 242_193_529)].into();

// 1. How regularly are peaks spaced?
//    Returns SpacingStats: mean/median/std/IQR plus log-space stats that
//    handle heavy-tailed gap distributions. Small log_std => regular arrays
//    (CTCF-style); large log_std => bursty pileups.
let spacing = peaks.calc_inter_peak_spacing();
println!("n_gaps={}, median={:.0} bp, log_std={:.2}",
    spacing.n_gaps, spacing.median, spacing.log_std);

// 2. How much does the peak set cluster at a 5 kb stitching radius?
//    Single-linkage clustering — two peaks link if the gap between them is
//    ≤ radius_bp. The default `min_cluster_size = 2` answers "fraction of
//    peaks that have at least one neighbor within 5 kb", matching typical
//    super-enhancer-stitching / enhancer-clustering analyses.
let clusters = peaks.calc_peak_clusters(5_000, 2);
println!(
    "{} clusters, {:.1}% of peaks clustered, biggest={}",
    clusters.n_clusters,
    clusters.fraction_clustered * 100.0,
    clusters.max_cluster_size,
);

// 3. Dense per-window count vector across the whole genome — an ML-ready
//    feature vector. Stable karyotypic ordering means vectors from different
//    BED files are aligned column-for-column, so you can stack them into a
//    matrix and feed to downstream models.
let density = peaks.calc_density_vector(&chrom_sizes, 250);
println!("density vector: {} windows, bin_width={} bp",
    density.counts.len(), density.bin_width);

// 4. How evenly is the peak set spread across the genome, as a scalar?
//    Mean count per window + variance + coefficient of variation (Poisson
//    ≈ 1, clustered >> 1, even << 1) + Gini + nonzero-window count. The
//    canonical "how uniform is this peak set" measure.
let homog = peaks.calc_density_homogeneity(&chrom_sizes, 250);
println!(
    "mean={:.2}, CV={:.2}, gini={:.3}, {}/{} windows nonzero",
    homog.mean_count, homog.cv, homog.gini,
    homog.n_nonzero_windows, homog.n_windows,
);
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

| method | question it answers | wraps | returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `calc_inter_peak_spacing()` | "How regularly are my peaks spaced?" — mean/median/std/IQR and log-space stats of inter-peak gaps | `calc_neighbor_distances` | `SpacingStats` |
| `calc_peak_clusters(radius_bp, min_cluster_size)` | "How clumpy is my peak set at a given stitching radius?" — cluster counts, sizes, and the fraction of peaks in multi-peak clusters | `cluster(radius_bp)` from `IntervalRanges` | `ClusterStats` |
| `calc_density_vector(chrom_sizes, n_bins)` | "Give me a stable, ML-ready per-window count vector across the whole genome" — dense, zero-padded, karyotypically ordered | per-region midpoint binning | `DensityVector` |
| `calc_density_homogeneity(chrom_sizes, n_bins)` | "How evenly are my peaks spread across the genome, as a scalar?" — mean/variance/CV/Gini of the density vector | `calc_density_vector` | `DensityHomogeneity` |

### Output structs

```rust
pub struct ChromosomeStatistics {
    pub chromosome: String,
    pub number_of_regions: u32,
    pub start_nucleotide_position: u32,  // leftmost start
    pub end_nucleotide_position: u32,    // rightmost end
    pub minimum_region_length: u32,
    pub maximum_region_length: u32,
    pub mean_region_length: f64,
    pub median_region_length: f64,
}

pub struct RegionBin { pub chr: String, pub start: u32, pub end: u32, pub n: u32, pub rid: u32 }

pub struct SpacingStats {
    pub n_gaps: usize,
    pub mean: f64, pub median: f64, pub std: f64, pub iqr: f64,
    pub log_mean: f64, pub log_std: f64,
}

pub struct ClusterStats {
    pub radius_bp: u32,
    pub n_clusters: usize,
    pub n_clustered_peaks: usize,

}

pub struct DensityVector {
    pub n_bins: u32,        // target bins for the longest chromosome
    pub bin_width: u32,     // derived as max_chrom_len / n_bins, floored, min 1
    pub counts: Vec<u32>,   // dense, row-major across chromosomes in karyotype order
    pub chrom_offsets: Vec<(String, usize)>,
}

pub struct DensityHomogeneity {
    pub bin_width: u32,
    pub n_windows: usize,
    pub n_nonzero_windows: usize,
    pub mean_count: f64,
    pub variance: f64,
    pub cv: f64,
    pub gini: f64,
}
```

!!! warning "Output length for spacing/nearest calculations"
    `calc_neighbor_distances` and `calc_nearest_neighbors` **skip single-region chromosomes** (matching R GenomicDistributions behavior). The output length is therefore **not 1:1 with the input region count** — it's the number of multi-region chromosomes' regions. No sentinel values are emitted. If you need 1:1 alignment, filter your input to multi-region chromosomes first.

!!! warning "`n_bins` is a target, not a total"
    In `calc_density_vector`, `calc_density_homogeneity`, and `region_distribution_with_chrom_sizes`, `n_bins` is the target bin count for the **longest** chromosome in `chrom_sizes`. Bin width is derived from that, and every chromosome is tiled at the same bp width — so shorter chromosomes get fewer bins and the total bin count is `sum(ceil(chrom_size / bin_width))`, which can exceed `n_bins` substantially. To target a specific bin width in bp, set `n_bins = max_chrom_len / desired_bp`.

## Interval set algebra

`IntervalRanges` is a second trait on `RegionSet` that provides GRanges/IRanges-style set algebra. All operations return new `RegionSet`s (immutable pattern) and are strand-unaware by default — use `StrandedRegionSet` if you need strand-aware promoters, reduce, or setdiff.

```rust
use gtars_core::models::RegionSet;
use gtars_genomicdist::IntervalRanges;

let a = RegionSet::try_from("peaks_a.bed")?;
let b = RegionSet::try_from("peaks_b.bed")?;

let merged   = a.reduce();                         // merge overlapping intervals
let common   = a.intersect(&b);                    // range-level intersection
let a_only   = a.setdiff(&b);                      // remove b from a
let combined = a.union(&b);                        // union + reduce
let jac      = a.jaccard(&b);                      // bp-Jaccard similarity
let closest  = a.closest(&b);                      // Vec<(a_idx, b_idx, dist)>
let clustered = a.cluster(1000);                   // per-region cluster id
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

### Method reference

| `reduce()` | merge overlapping/adjacent intervals per chromosome |
| `setdiff(other)` / `subtract(other)` | remove `other` from self |

!!! note "`rest` fields are dropped"
    Operations that merge or synthesize new intervals (reduce, setdiff, promoters, etc.) produce regions with `rest: None`. There is no unambiguous way to carry the original metadata through a merge, so the contract is: use `IntervalRanges` methods for coordinate-only work.

### `pairwise_jaccard`

A standalone helper for computing the full N×N Jaccard matrix over a slice of region sets, optimized to pre-reduce each set once and walk pairs linearly:

```rust
use gtars_genomicdist::pairwise_jaccard;

let sets = vec![rs1, rs2, rs3];
let jac = pairwise_jaccard(&sets); // Vec<f64> of length 9 (row-major)

for i in 0..3 {
    for j in 0..3 {
        print!("{:.3} ", jac[i * 3 + j]);
    }
    println!();
}
```

### RegionSetListOps

`RegionSetListOps` implements the same set-algebra operations on a `RegionSetList` by index — useful for bindings (wasm/Python/R) that want to operate on pairs without copying whole `RegionSet`s across an FFI boundary.

```rust
use gtars_core::models::RegionSetList;
use gtars_genomicdist::RegionSetListOps;

let rsl = RegionSetList::try_from(vec!["a.bed", "b.bed", "c.bed"])?;

let jac_01 = rsl.jaccard_at(0, 1);                   // Option<f64>
let union_02 = rsl.union_at(0, 2);                   // Option<RegionSet>
let drop_one = rsl.union_except(1);                  // union of all but index 1
let (full_union, loo) = rsl.bulk_union_except()      // all leave-one-out unions in O(n)
    .ok_or("empty list")?;
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

Methods: `pintersect_at`, `pintersect_count`, `jaccard_at`, `union_at`, `setdiff_at`, `region_count`, `union_except`, `bulk_union_except`, `union_all`, `intersect_all`.

## Partitions

Ports of `genomePartitionList()`, `calcPartitions()`, and `calcExpectedPartitions()` from R GenomicDistributions. You load a gene model from BED files or GTF, build an ordered `PartitionList` of promoter / UTR / exon / intron categories, and classify your query regions into mutually exclusive buckets (`intergenic` is added as the implicit remainder).

```rust
use gtars_core::models::RegionSet;
use gtars_genomicdist::{
    GeneModel, calc_partitions, calc_expected_partitions, genome_partition_list,
};
use std::collections::HashMap;

// 1. Load the gene model (choose one)
let model = GeneModel::from_bed_files(
    "genes.bed",
    "exons.bed",
    Some("three_utr.bed"),  // optional
    Some("five_utr.bed"),   // optional
)?;

// Or, from a GTF:
// let model = GeneModel::from_gtf("gencode.v47.gtf.gz", true, true)?;

// 2. Build partition list (core/prox promoter sizes in bp; chrom_sizes optional)
let partitions = genome_partition_list(&model, 100, 2000, None);

// 3. Classify query regions
let query = RegionSet::try_from("peaks.bed")?;

let result = calc_partitions(&query, &partitions, /* bp_proportion = */ false);
for (name, count) in &result.counts {
    let pct = *count as f64 / result.total as f64 * 100.0;
    println!("{:<15} {:>6}  ({:.1}%)", name, count, pct);
}

// 4. Observed vs expected, with chi-square p-value
let chrom_sizes: HashMap<String, u32> = [("chr1".into(), 248_956_422)].into_iter().collect();
let expected = calc_expected_partitions(&query, &partitions, &chrom_sizes, false);
for row in &expected.rows {
    println!(
        "{:<15} obs={:>6}  exp={:>10.1}  log10(O/E)={:+.2}  p={:.2e}",
        row.partition, row.observed, row.expected, row.log10_oe, row.chi_sq_pval
    );
}
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

### Priority order

`genome_partition_list` produces partitions in this order, which is also the priority for classification:

1. **`promoterCore`** — `core_prom_size` bp upstream of each gene start (strand-aware).
2. **`promoterProx`** — `prox_prom_size` bp upstream, minus core.
3. **`threeUTR`** — if UTR files are provided.
4. **`fiveUTR`** — minus 3'UTR (R gives 3'UTR priority).
5. **`exon`** — minus UTRs.
6. **`intron`** — gene bodies minus UTRs and exons.
7. **`intergenic`** — implicit remainder, emitted by `calc_partitions`.

`calc_partitions` has two modes:

- **Priority mode (`bp_proportion = false`)** — each query region is assigned to the first partition it overlaps; remainders are counted as `intergenic`. Mutually exclusive.
- **BP proportion mode (`bp_proportion = true`)** — for each partition, computes total overlapping base pairs of query. Not mutually exclusive: a query region overlapping multiple partitions contributes bp to each (matching R behavior).

!!! note "Chi-square p-values differ from R"
    `calc_expected_partitions` uses a goodness-of-fit `(O-E)²/E` formula. R's `chisq.test()` computes a 2×2 test of independence with optional Yates correction, so p-values will not match R GenomicDistributions output byte-for-byte. The `log10_oe` column is directly comparable.

### `GeneModel::from_gtf`

GTF loading handles GENCODE-style files that use an undifferentiated `UTR` feature type by parsing `CDS` records to infer which UTRs are 5' vs 3'. Two flags:

- `filter_protein_coding` — keep only features with `gene_biotype "protein_coding"` or `gene_type "protein_coding"` in the attributes column.
- `convert_ensembl_ucsc` — prepend `chr` to chromosome names that don't already have it (so Ensembl `1` becomes UCSC `chr1`).

## Signal matrix overlap

`SignalMatrix` holds a matrix of signal values across genomic regions × conditions (e.g. a peak × cell-type matrix of ChIP-seq intensities). `calc_summary_signal` overlaps a query region set against the matrix, aggregates by MAX per query region, and returns Tukey boxplot statistics per condition.

```rust
use gtars_core::models::{RegionSet, CoordinateMode};
use gtars_genomicdist::{SignalMatrix, calc_summary_signal};

// Load from a TSV where col 0 is "chr_start_end", remaining cols are condition values
let sm = SignalMatrix::from_tsv("signal_matrix.tsv")?;

// Or load from the packed binary format (produced by sm.save_bin())
let sm = SignalMatrix::load_bin("signal_matrix.sigm")?;
// ...or from an in-memory byte slice (for wasm):
// let sm = SignalMatrix::load_bin_from_bytes(&bytes)?;

let query = RegionSet::try_from("peaks.bed")?;
let summary = calc_summary_signal(&query, &sm, CoordinateMode::Bed)?;

for stats in &summary.matrix_stats {
    println!(
        "{}: median={:.2}  [{:.2}–{:.2}]",
        stats.condition, stats.median, stats.lower_hinge, stats.upper_hinge
    );
}
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

`SignalSummaryResult` contains per-query-region max signal vectors (`signal_matrix`), per-condition Tukey stats (`matrix_stats`), and `condition_names`. The packed binary format (`.sigm`, magic `SIGM`) is produced by `sm.save_bin()` — substantially faster to load than TSV for large matrices.

## Consensus regions

Given N region sets, `consensus` produces the reduced union annotated with how many input sets overlap each union region. Useful for filtering by replicate support threshold:

```rust
use gtars_core::models::RegionSet;
use gtars_genomicdist::{consensus, ConsensusRegion};

let reps = [
    RegionSet::try_from("rep1.bed")?,
    RegionSet::try_from("rep2.bed")?,
    RegionSet::try_from("rep3.bed")?,
];

let cons: Vec<ConsensusRegion> = consensus(&reps);

// Keep regions present in ≥ 2/3 replicates
let robust: Vec<_> = cons.into_iter().filter(|c| c.count >= 2).collect();
println!("{} robust regions", robust.len());
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

`ConsensusRegion` has `chr`, `start`, `end`, and `count` — the number of input sets overlapping that union region.

## TSS / nearest-feature distances

`TssIndex` builds a per-chromosome sorted vector of TSS midpoints from a `RegionSet`, enabling O(R · log M) distance queries instead of the naive O(R · M):

```rust
use gtars_core::models::{RegionSet, CoordinateMode};
use gtars_genomicdist::models::TssIndex;

let tss = TssIndex::try_from("gencode_tss.bed")?;

let peaks = RegionSet::try_from("peaks.bed")?;

// Unsigned nearest-feature distance per query region
let dists: Vec<u32> = tss.calc_tss_distances(&peaks, CoordinateMode::Bed)?;

// Signed distances (positive = feature downstream, negative = upstream)
let signed: Vec<i64> = tss.calc_feature_distances(&peaks, CoordinateMode::Bed)?;
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

Regions on chromosomes missing from the TSS index are padded with `u32::MAX` / `i64::MAX` sentinels (one per query region). Use `median_abs_distance(&signed)` from the `utils` module to summarize while filtering those sentinels.

## GC content and dinucleotide frequencies

Both functions take anything implementing `SequenceAccess` — currently `GenomeAssembly` (in-memory HashMap, built from a FASTA) or `BinaryGenomeAssembly` (mmap-backed `.fab` binary).

```rust
use gtars_core::models::RegionSet;
use gtars_genomicdist::{calc_gc_content, calc_dinucl_freq, DINUCL_ORDER};
use gtars_genomicdist::models::{GenomeAssembly, BinaryGenomeAssembly};

// In-memory loader — ~2s to build for hg38 but then gives zero-copy slices
let genome = GenomeAssembly::try_from("hg38.fa")?;

// Or the mmap .fab loader — instant construction, zero-copy per region
let genome = BinaryGenomeAssembly::from_file("hg38.fab".as_ref())?;

let peaks = RegionSet::try_from("peaks.bed")?;

// GC content per region, 0.0–1.0
let gc: Vec<f64> = calc_gc_content(&peaks, &genome, /* ignore_unk_chroms = */ true)?;

// Dinucleotide frequencies: 16 columns per region in DINUCL_ORDER
// raw_counts=false → percentages (matches R default)
let (labels, matrix) = calc_dinucl_freq(&peaks, &genome, false, true)?;
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

Create a `.fab` file from a regular FASTA once up-front:

```rust
use gtars_genomicdist::models::BinaryGenomeAssembly;

BinaryGenomeAssembly::write_from_fasta(
    "hg38.fa".as_ref(),
    "hg38.fab".as_ref(),
)?;
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

Or via the CLI: `gtars prep --fasta hg38.fa` (see the [gtars-cli](cli.md) page).

## BED classification

Under the `bedclassifier` feature, `classify_bed` inspects the column layout of a BED file and assigns one of several UCSC / ENCODE format classifications (BED3, BED6+, narrowPeak, broadPeak, gappedPeak, RNA elements, etc.).

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "bedclassifier")]

## GDA binary format

`GenomicDistAnnotation` is a serializable wrapper around `GeneModel` in the GDA (Genomic Dist Annotation) binary format. Chrom sizes are **not** stored in the GDA file — they come from a separate source (refgenie, `.chrom.sizes` file, or an API).

```rust
use gtars_genomicdist::GenomicDistAnnotation;

// Build from GTF once, save as GDA
let gda = GenomicDistAnnotation::from_gtf("gencode.v47.gtf.gz")?;
gda.save_bin("gencode.v47.gda")?;

// Load from disk
let gda = GenomicDistAnnotation::load_bin("gencode.v47.gda")?;

// Or from memory (wasm / API)
// let gda = GenomicDistAnnotation::load_bin_from_bytes(&bytes)?;

let partitions = gtars_genomicdist::genome_partition_list(&gda.gene_model, 100, 2000, None);
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

## Utilities

From `gtars_genomicdist::utils`:

- **`partition_genome_into_bins(chrom_sizes, n_bins)`** — tile all chromosomes with fixed-width bins (bin width = longest chrom / n_bins, floored, min 1 bp). Returns a `RegionSet`.
- **`median_abs_distance(&[i64])`** — median absolute value, filtering `i64::MAX` sentinels produced by `TssIndex::calc_feature_distances`.
- **`chrom_karyotype_key(chr)`** — sort key producing the standard karyotype order: `chr1, chr2, …, chr22, chrX, chrY, chrM, chrUn_*`. Works with or without the `chr` prefix.

## Strand-aware wrappers

Two wrappers extend `RegionSet` with stronger invariants:

- **`SortedRegionSet`** — a newtype guaranteeing `(chr, start)` sort order. Constructed via `SortedRegionSet::new(rs)`, which sorts in place (move, no clone). Downstream code that requires sorted input can accept `&SortedRegionSet` to avoid re-sorting on every call.
- **`StrandedRegionSet`** — pairs a `RegionSet` with a parallel `Vec<Strand>`. Strand-aware `promoters_stranded`, `reduce`, `setdiff`, and `trim` are methods on this type and are used internally by `genome_partition_list` to produce correct partitions for minus-strand genes.

```rust
use gtars_core::models::RegionSet;
use gtars_genomicdist::{SortedRegionSet, StrandedRegionSet, Strand};

let rs = RegionSet::try_from("peaks.bed")?;
let sorted = SortedRegionSet::new(rs); // in-place sort

let stranded = StrandedRegionSet::new(
    sorted.0.clone(),
    vec![Strand::Plus; sorted.0.regions.len()],
);
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

`Strand::from_char('+' | '-' | _)` converts a single character to `Plus` / `Minus` / `Unstranded`.

## Errors

All operations that can fail return `Result<T, GtarsGenomicDistError>`. Variants:

- `CustomError(String)` — general I/O and parsing wrapper.
- `GCContentError(chr, start, end, msg)` — sequence lookup failed during GC calculation.
- `TSSContentError(msg)` — no TSS features found for the region set.
- `SignalMatrixError(msg)` — signal-matrix parse failure.
- `Io(std::io::Error)` — transparent I/O error.

The `bedclassifier` feature has its own `BedClassifierError` enum for format-classification failures.

## Where to go next

- **[gtars-core](core.md)** — `RegionSet`, `RegionSetList`, and `CoordinateMode`, which this crate consumes.
- **[gtars-lola](lola.md)** — LOLA enrichment is built on `IntervalRanges` (for universe construction) and the IGD index.
- **[gtars-overlaprs](overlaprs.md)** — the overlap-detection engine used internally by `calc_partitions` and `consensus`.
- **[gtars CLI](cli.md)** — `gtars genomicdist` subcommands for running these analyses from the command line.
